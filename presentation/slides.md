# Options for testing Power Apps

---

# Options for testing Power Apps

- Manual Testing
- Test Studio
- Test Engine
- Other tools üëâ Playwright

---

# Test Studio

A low-code solution to automate testing of canvas apps.

## The good

- Test step recorder
- Test editor
- Test playback

## The bad

- Power Fx üôà
- Slow and not intuitive
- Not platform agnostic
- Debugging is hard

---

# Test Engine

Takes Test Studio to the next level by using Playwright.

## The good

- You can start with from Test Studio
- Connector mocking
- Screenshots

## The bad

- Still Power Fx üôà
- Small community
- Limited functionality
- Debugging is hard

---

# Using Playwright

Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps.

## The good

- Became a standard
- Cross-browser / cross-platform / cross-language
- Full control over tests and scripts
- Debugging
- No vendor or platform lock-in

## The bad

- Requires coding

# Using Playwright

#### Navigation

```ts
await page.goto('https://eliostruyf.com');
```

<br />

#### Get an element

```ts
const title = page.locator('header h2');
```

<br />

#### Test assertion

```ts
await expect(title).toHaveText('Elio Struyf');
```

<v-click>
  <Arrow v-bind="{ x1:345, y1:300, x2:500, y2:125, color: '#FF004C' }" />
</v-click>

    white-space: pre-wrap !important;
    line-height: 22px !important;
  }
</style>

---

# Validating the elements

#### Check if an element is visible

```tsx
await expect(locator).toBeVisible();
```

<br />

#### Check if an element contains text

```tsx
await expect(locator).toHaveText(/Elio/);
```

<br />

#### Check the number of elements

```tsx
await expect(locator).toHaveCount(5);
```
